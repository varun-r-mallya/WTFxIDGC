# Chromatica 
(SDSLabs team submission for WTFxIDGC 2024 Game Jam)
- Written in *Godot*, this beautiful piece of art builds on the themes of `Chain Reactions` and `Starting from nothing`
- You start with a world devoid of colours where you need to help Iris collect colour crystals scattered across 7 rainbow themed levels.
- Our unique game mechanic makes it incredibly hard and frustruating to cross levels. When you break a wooden block, the other blocks around it break with a time delay. You can find the logic for this `scenes/scripts/Scripts.gd`.
